# TraVeLGAN-Keras
An implementation of TraVeLGAN using Keras framework

Just a week project I'm currently working on. I'm trying to implement the [TraVeLGAN: Image-to-image Translation by Transformation Vector Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09631) paper.


## Current State

Just finished a very rough draft of the different networks and the training process. As spected is not learning anything so is a work in progress.
Any help, criticism, ideas are very wellcome.
